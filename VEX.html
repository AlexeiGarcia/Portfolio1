  	<h2>VEX Robotics</h2>
	  <h3>
		  <p>The VEX Robotics Competition is a middle school and high school level international competition that uses VEX robotics
		  parts and RobotC programming in competition that rotates every year.  Teams of students are tasked with designing and 
		  building a robot to play against other teams in a game-based engineering challenge. Classroom STEM concepts are put to
		  the test as students learn lifelong skills in teamwork, leadership, communications, and more. Tournaments are held year
		  -round at the regional, state, and national levels and culminate at the VEX Robotics World Championship each April!</p>
		  <p>VEX at Skyline competes in competitions across the state to build a robot to compete based on the year’s theme, such
			  as launching, lifting, and manipulating field objects.  I serve as Vice-President of Skyline VEX and co-founded 
			  the curricular club in 2014 and later the full VEX Robotics class in 2016.</p>
